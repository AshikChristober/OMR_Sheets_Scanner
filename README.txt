OMR Sheets Scanner is made to detect universal OMR sheets across the globe,yes this is the actual objective of this project but so far this version of omr scanner failed due to the following reasons:
1) Used Object detection to and detect regions and bubbles--failed in recognizing noisy templates and uneven printing of OMR sheets.
    So far in this project I have used YOLOv8 to detect regions as objects first,  i have labelled as answer region, signature region, personal_details region, QR region. I  have used 'Roboflow' to annotate the images and took .txt files out of it. And then trained the model using YOLOv8 to detect regions. The main thing is i have collected data from an IAS academy used answer sheets and made it as datasets."Yes it failed", now i could understand why this things happened for a project like OMR Sheet scanner we need "Image understanding" not object detection as i have gone through many recent IEEE papers they have only used these object detection with some geometrical mapping but so far no one used image understanding. So the version two of this will be having the clean "OMR sheets scanner using Image Understanding Techniques".
